# FastTyper
FastTyper is a program where the user is presented with text and the goal is to type the presented text correctly and quickly.

The user can **add** and **modify** which texts are presented by adding and modifying the text files in the directory _predictionTexts_.

The user can **start** FastTyper by running the Main method in _Game.java_.


### The motivation behind FastTyper
I've always been interested in writing my own little game where the user has to type quickly. Practicing in this ought to increase one's productivity.

I also wanted to refresh and strengthen my Java and testing skills.
